create a train_secrets.py that includes three lines:
- your National Rail Enquiries Darwin Lite access key
- the station code for the left-hand side of the display
- the station code for the right-hand side of the display

use railmiles.me to manually(!) cache the distances between each station pair in cached_milage.py

this project uses virtualenv
